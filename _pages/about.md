## About me

I am a **fourth-year undergraduate student** at the **University of Cambridge**, with a strong interest in **digital circuit design**. After I graduate with an **MEng** in **2026**, I plan to continue in academia, then eventually join the industry and build chips that improve the lives of as many people as possible.

I am inherently an **engineer**. I love building things hands-on, and seeing them work. I like to keep things neat and tidy, from my room in college to Python docstrings.

## Projects

I am currently working on **performance feedback and modelling for high-level synthesis (HLS)**, under supervision of [Prof. Zhiru Zhang](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~zhiruz/) and his PhD student, [Niansong Zhang](https://www.zzzdavid.tech/).

Past projects include RISC-V processor design, and an arbitrary-precision rendering accelerator for [Gaussian splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/) (see [CV](/cv/) for details).
