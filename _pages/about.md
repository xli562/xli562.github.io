Hello, thanks for visiting my personal website.

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge, with a strong interest in the broad area of digital circuit design. After I graduate with an MEng in 2026, I plan to continue in academia, then eventually join the industry and build chips that improve the lives of as many people as possible.

I am inherently an **engineer**! I love building things hands-on, and seeing them work. I like to keep things neat and tidy, from my room in college to my Python docstrings.

## Projects

I am currently working on **performance feedback and modelling for high-level synthesis (HLS)** at Cornell University, supervized by [Prof. Zhiru Zhang](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~zhiruz/) and his PhD student, [Niansong Zhang](https://www.zzzdavid.tech/).

My past projects include RISC-V processor design, and an arbitrary-precision rendering accelerator for [Gaussian splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/) (see [CV](/cv/) for details).
