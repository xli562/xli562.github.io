## Hobbies

Films, badminton, skiing, swimming, table tennis, hiking, coding, cooking, socializing (sometimes). At one point, I realized that all games are ultimately a pile of code, after which I lost much interest in gaming.

Reading. I enjoy Kazuo Ishiguro and Hemingway. I also quite like _Dune_.

Classical music. I started with everything, then developed a preference for the mid-to-late romantic period. When I got bored later, I started listening to Bach and Schoenberg. I also sometimes enjoy pieces from Mozart, Schubert, Shostakovich and so on. When I get bored with classical music (not very often), I listen to everything from jazz to rock and beyond.
